Terms & Conditions
The F1 Results API is an experimental web service which provides a historical
record of motor racing data fornon-commercial purposes.

The author grants you the right to create your own applications and services
based on this API provided that theseconform to the conditions specified in
this document.

Terms Of Use
You may use this API for personal, non-commercial applications and services
including educational and research purposes. Use by websites and applications
supported by advertising is permitted. However, you must not charge for any
application or service which makes use of this API or for any data obtained
from it.

Responsible Use
You must not create any application which polls the API more than four times
per second or more than 200 times per hour. Applications and users exceeding
these rates are likely to be blocked. Caching is permitted and encouraged.

The API has been designed so that most queries can be satisfied without the
need to call methods from within a loop and this practice is strongly discouraged.
An app should require a user action before initiating a finite number of requests.

If you do call the API from within a loop it must incorporate a delay so that
the above limits are not exceeded and it must be designed to terminate after a
small, finite number of iterations under all conditions.

Attribution
You are not required to attribute this site in applications or services using
this API. However, an attribution would be appreciated when addressing a technical
audience.

Disclaimer
The author disclaims all responsibility for any loss or damage arising from
the use of this API. The author cannot guarantee the continuing availability
of the API or the accuracy of the data.
